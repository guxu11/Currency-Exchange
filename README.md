## Currency Converter

### 0. Introduction

I developed a currency converter to convert one country's currencies to another. You can also view the exchange rate fluctuation in the past 7 days.

This application has 2 pages, the first is the convertion page, you can type in amount, select from-currency and to-currency, then click convert, the result will be shown on this page.

The second page is to draw figures to reflect the exchange rate fluctuation between two currencies. Just select the from-currency and to-currency then the figure will be shown.
